      <p>
        During the 80s he wrote a number of games in 68000 assembler for the Atari ST, and almost had a title published by Electronic Arts. In 1993, he won an award for his final year undergraduate project at Warwick University, a vector-based satellite navigation system for cars, written in C++ and XWin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Malcolm's first roles post-university led him into Unix systems administration and from there to becoming an Oracle DBA, before finding a route back into full-time programming with Java in 1996. He was part of the original team that built jcoverage, which became Coburtura, still a hugely popular tool for measuring test code coverage for Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1998 he built one of the first Java EJB servers — EJBHome — which was acquired by IONA Technologies the following year. At IONA he co-led the team that created their J2EE application server, one of the first to receive a compatibility certification from Sun. Malcolm built the first version of the JSP engine, sitting on Sun’s EJB 2.0 technical committee and won the President’s Award for revolutionising IONA’s approach to product packaging.

        Malcolm has worked for many years as a developer, consultant, speaker and trainer in Agile methodologies in various sectors, including banking and telecommunications.

      <p class="py-4">

        Here's a talk I gave at JUXT's 10 year birthday celebration
        last May (2023). We're always trying to think of ways to
        dramatically simplify IT architectures, which almost always
        become over-complicated for little gain. This talk presents
        the possibility of a 2-tier architecture where the usual
        business-logic backend and database tiers are merged.
