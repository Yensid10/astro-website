## About

JUXT is a cutting-edge software consultancy that delivers innovation to large enterprises and
high-performing organisations.

Our projects come in all shapes and sizes, from building large systems for Tier 1 investment
banks to building small, bespoke applications for early-stage startups. The common thread is
our focus on software excellence and a keen eye for simplicity in both architecture and
implementation.

At JUXT we value autonomy. Autonomy is a key ingredient for satisfaction at work, and part
of our vision is a light-touch approach to hierarchy and management. We find and hire
people who can work independently, can develop ideas about their career growth, and can
make mature decisions about the direction of the projects they work on.

## The Role

We are about to embark on an exciting greenfield project with a tier one investment bank,
who have been a long standing client of ours. We are building new data warehousing tools,
pulling data from a variety of trading systems, in order to comply with banking data
regulations. You will be joining this project right at the very start, as we begin the discovery
phase, so this is an excellent chance to help shape the direction and architecture of the build
out. You will also be given autonomy to make key technical decisions, as well as help grow
the team, as we are looking to hire several developers at varying levels of experience to
build out this new flagship team.

The ideal candidate to join this project is someone who enjoys solving complex problems,
someone who is curious and happy to take time researching new technologies or solutions.
We are ideally looking for an experienced data architect/software engineer who can take a
lead on this project to advise on the best architectural patterns and understand the complex
data sets this system will consume. You will be someone who thinks about the bigger picture
whilst not shying away from rolling your sleeves up with investigative work. As this is a
mission critical project, there is a strong focus on delivery within this team, so a
delivery-focused mindset is essential.
