# What is JUXT?

JUXT is a software consultancy built by developers. We believe that we
can deliver excellent software through the marriage of People, Process,
and Tools.

It was founded in 2012 by Malcolm Sparks and Jon Pither, who saw the
difference modern technologies can bring in eliminating the common waste
found in IT organisations. Both were simultaneously introducing Clojure
at two different UK investment banks, and collaborated to grow a network
of similarly minded craftspeople.

Along with wanting to help our clients deliver software, we also
contribute to open-source software, provide resources for the community,
and speak at conferences.

# JUXT is a network

JUXT is a growing group of developers consisting of both full-time
consultants and associates. We also have a large global communication
network of similarly minded developers.

# Development Centre

JUXT has a software development center based in Milton Keynes, UK.

Our development center is a dedicated space for us to build fantastic
bespoke software for our clients. We take on remote development projects
across time-zones to build systems with the best technologies, using our
collective experience to provide quality, oversight, and rapid delivery.

# On-site Delivery and Consulting

We have worked side-by-side with our clients on a range of high profile
projects. We have large amounts of experience in helping other
development teams get up to speed with Clojure. We can provide project
leadership, project bootstrapping, and our seasoned consultants can help
get our clients over the delivery line.

# The name

We chose the name JUXT because we want to _juxtapose_ ourselves next to
the client, to work with them to solve problems. `juxt` is also a
function in the Clojure programming language.

    ((juxt a b c) x) => [(a x) (b x) (c x)]
