Over at our [training page](/training.html) you'll find details of our
upcoming Clojure training course, with Datomic and GraphQL, all using
the very latest Clojure 1.9 tooling.

We really enjoy giving our training courses---it's a great way to get
Clojure training from expert Clojure developers and also right up to
date with the latest Clojure trends.

With only a couple of weeks to go and just a few places left, we've
reduced the price by 20% to Â£320 (ex. VAT), so don't miss out. Book
[here](/training.html).
