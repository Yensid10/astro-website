New tools like ChatGPT can revolutionise the way that we work. They can be our partner through problem solving, they can be our personal tutor  or they can automate boring tasks giving us the time to focus on what's interesting and what's next.

In this presentation, I'll take you on a deep dive into the fascinating world of ChatGPT and 'Prompt Engineering'. I'll help you understand how ChatGPT works, its strengths and weaknesses, and how we can optimise its performance using specific Prompt Engineering techniques. 

We'll explore basic concepts such as your prompt checklist and gradually move to advanced applications involving DALL-E and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). We'll end with a fun and effective approach of using this powerful AI tool as your personal tutor. If you want to fully take advantage of ChatGPT, this presentation will show you how. Hopefully by the end, you'll want to take ChatGPT along with you as your problem solving partner too. Let's help you get your ChatGPT experiences from good to great!
