# A postscript on packages

In the talk I mentioned my experimental work with bundling resources into packages.
This makes it easier for users to install a number of resources as a group.
However, I have since realised that packages are a source of complexity.
Packages aggregate the dependencies between their member resources and member resources contained in other packages.
The effect of this aggregation is that you end up installing more resources than you would otherwise need.
This can result in a greater chance of conflicts between package versions.
I believe that the fundamental unit in web design is the resource, and resources should not be subject to being grouped with others without a much better reason than I can muster for packages.

The problem is explained much better in [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyLBGkS5ICk) by Rich Hickey, where is describes 'dependency problems' as 'productivity and soul-crushing at worst'.
Combining Rich's points onto my terminology: 'Packages don't actually _use_ other packages. There is nothing in resources about packages'.

Code frequently has dependencies on other code, and we've been doing this since the 1950s.
Programs contain implicit dependency graphs between procedures and functions.

The beauty of a web resource is that it exists independently of other resources.
That's the point, since on the web each resource can evolve independently.
