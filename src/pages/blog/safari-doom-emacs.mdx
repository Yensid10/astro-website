In this episode of JUXT Safari we dive into the world of Doom Emacs; an opinionated, highly-customizable Emacs configuration that aims to provide a streamlined and efficient workflow for developers.

I’m a long-time Emacs user and contributor to the Doom Emacs project and in this talk, I explore the current state of Doom Emacs, its key features and benefits, and some tips and tricks for getting the most out of it.

If you’re curious about Doom Emacs and want to learn more about its unique approach to Emacs configuration, or if you’re already a Doom Emacs user looking to improve your workflow, then this JUXT Safari is for you.
