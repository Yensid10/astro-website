Finn Voelkel (@fin) mentioned to me last week that he thought the on-ramp to [Site 2.0](https://github.com/juxt-site/site) was a little steep, and I agreed.
There are quite a few steps involved in getting a Site instance running on a new machine.
Although I really like the `mkcert` tool that Alex (@alx) suggested, it does add more steps, including the need to installing and configuring nginx as a reverse proxy.

Meanwhile, I'd been in conversations with Jack Tolley (@jck) about how to ease Site's bootstrapping procedure, up to the point that a user can access and authenticate with Site using a browser.
Site supports all manners of authentication, (classic 'basic http' auth, form-based auth with cookies through to OpenID Connect).
But whichever authentication scheme the user might choose, there will be some things to configure out-of-the-box.
