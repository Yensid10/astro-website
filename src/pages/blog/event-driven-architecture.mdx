# Understanding an Organisation's Event Driven Architecture

During the discovery or design of an EDA it's important to understand what EDA means to those involved. In the [introduction](../eventing), we alluded to the large scope of EDA being a socio-technical problem to overcome.

The issues start almost at the highest level of concepts.  EDA is to Architects as Transducers are to Clojure, in that a lot of people have written a lot about how to think about each ðŸ˜ƒ.

# Towards an Informal Taxonomy 

We will use the below diagram to explore the foundations of EDA.  Ideally, you will be able to place your own organisation's location on the map.  Hopefully,  it will reveal the trade-offs about other locations.

# The Layers

## Building Blocks

### Message Oriented Middleware (1)

Whilst it is not technically necessary to use a message bus when building an EDA (3a), in practice the majority of projects seem to (3b).

A message bus (1) decouples systems in both time and location: producers of messages need not know which and when a consumer processes a message.

Common technologies in this space include Kafka, SQS, Kinesis, and  Pub/Sub.  They provide other desirable features such as scalability, delivery semantics, and ordering guarantees.

If an EDA is centred around transferring events between systems it should come as no surprise a Message Oriented Middleware is often reached for.

### Event-store Infrastructure (2)

Event-stores (2) can be used both independently and in conjunction with Message Oriented Middleware.  Oftentimes an event-store stack will provide event-routing for you.

When using event-sourcing as a state persistence pattern for a DDD aggregate, an event-store is the repository to which these events are stored (6c, 6d).   However, some projects will not have evolved from a DDD foundation and the thinking is not in terms of aggregates but event streams (5c, 5d).

Common technologies in this space include EventStoreDB, Axon, and MartenDB.  They tend to include desirable features like strong consistency on append, optimistic concurrency, and global ordering.  When Event-store Infrastructure is not used for Event Sourcing (6b, 5b) then these features are often replicated by developers themselves using the features of the Message Oriented Middleware (1).

## Design

### Event Driven Architecture (3)

The common denominator throughout Event Driven Architecture is the "event".  From Wikipedia's entry on EDA:

  "An event can be defined as 'a significant change in state'"
  
and

  "Events do not travel, they just occur. However, the term event is often used metonymically to denote the notification message itself, which may lead to some confusion."
  
For the taxonomy (3) we will say "An event is, at the least, a notification of something that has happened in the past".  The "at the least" allows the event to move beyond simple notification and perhaps carry some pertinent state (event-carried-state-transfer).  On inherited software projects, unfortunately, we don't get to declare what an event is.  Fowler notes the trap of using events passive-aggressively as commands.  And this trap is prevalent - expect many cerebral contortions to justify a project's thinking e.g. "action events" or "the issuance of command is itself an event".  There are many articles on Commands vs Events.

Whilst Message Driven Architectures (3b) and Event-stores (3b) it is possible to combine these stacks (5c, 6c) or not use them at all (3a). There is a lot to implement if one goes down this route (3a).
