# Understanding an Organisation's Event Driven Architecture

During the discovery or design of an EDA it's important to understand what EDA means to those involved. In the [introduction](../eventing) we alluded to the large scope of EDA being a scion-technical problem to overcome.

The issues start almost at the highest level of concepts.  EDA is to Architects as Transducers are to Clojure, in that a lot of people have written a lot about how to think about each ðŸ˜ƒ.

# Towards an Informal Taxonomy 

We will use the below diagram to explore the foundations of EDA.  Ideally, you will be able to place your own organisation's location on the map.  Hopefully,  it will reveal the trade-offs about other locations.
