Our guest is <a href="https://relyabilit.ie/">Niall Murphy</a>, CEO of [Stanza](https://www.stanza.systems/) - a company founded by a group of experienced SREs with a vision to provide the tools, coding platform, culture and community to give any organization industry-leading reliability. Niall previously worked at Google where he co-authored the book <a href="https://sre.google/books/">"Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems" (2016)</a>.<br/>

In this podcast episode, we discussed Niall's extensive experience including his role within an important era for Google's infrastructure transformation beginning in the late 2000s, and the wider contemporary challenges in the SRE landscape.

Niall's reflections on operating distributed systems has lead him to the conclusion that there is still a profound missing gap in SRE tooling between discovering 'signals' and taking 'actions'.

The conversation begins by alluding to a couple of other recent podcasts we've recorded on distributed systems in 2024, one with <a href="/blog/promise-theory-with-mark-burgess/">Mark Burgess</a> and the other with <a href="/blog/distributed-consistency-podcast/">Andr√°s Gerlits</a>.
