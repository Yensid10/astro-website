Greetings, fellow tech enthusiasts!

As we look back at a decade of code, camaraderie, and continuous innovation at JUXT, I’m thrilled to share the technological feast that unfolded during our 10-year anniversary celebration.

At the core of our DNA lies a commitment to the art and science of software development — an ethos that permeates every aspect of JUXT as a company created by developers, for developers.

Our anniversary bash wasn't just about commemorating the years; it was an opportunity for our brilliant software engineers to showcase their prowess through a series of captivating tech talks.

In this post, you can access five presentations that span the landscape of our craft. From unravelling the intricacies of backends to the avant-garde fusion of Clojure and algorithmic art, these talks delved into the very fabric of software architecture, databases, frontends, and the intriguing realm of bitemporality.
Join me in reliving the inspiring insights and ideas that echoed through our anniversary celebration — a testament to a decade of pioneering spirit and the limitless possibilities that lie ahead.

Welcome to the crossroads of innovation and expertise at JUXT. Enjoy!

### Backends. Where did they come from and why are they here?
Malcolm Sparks, JUXT Co-founder & CTO

During JUXT 10-Year Anniversary, JUXT CTO Malcolm Sparks opened the internal tech talks with a Keynote on backends.

### Databases, compilers, and XTDB
Finn Völkel, Software Developer

In this tech talk, Finn looks at some similarities and not so apparent differences of compilers and databases in the context of XTDB, a bitemporal and dynamic relational database for SQL and Datalog.

### UPDATE Considered Harmful
Jeremy Taylor, Head of Product

SQL is almost 50 years old and the cost of storage has decreased dramatically over its lifetime. 

In this talk, Jeremy Taylor explains why SQL's UPDATE statement is problematic in our modern context and how developers are forced to work around it. 
He also examines 'bitemporality' — a standardised model for working with versioned historical data that mitigates the need for such workarounds.

### The State of Frontend
Alex Davis, Lead Engineer

'Frontend Web Development' has a bad reputation for being overly complex and difficult to keep up with, but is there still truth to this these days? And what tools should I use for my next (or first!) ClojureScript web application? 
Find out in this talk by JUXT lead engineer Alex Davis.

### Exploring Design
Mike Bruce, Sr. Software Engineer

If you haven’t had much interest in design, maybe it’s time to have another look. 
After taking what he thought would be a brief look into design, JUXT software engineer Mike Bruce found it was much more interesting and a deeper topic than he had originally thought.

### Where is the Artist in Algorithmic Art?
Frances Jackson-Barry, Software Developer

How have algorithmic artists working in code challenged traditional models of artists, artworks and audiences? How could coding creatively give us a new perspective on our everyday programming? 

In her talk, software engineer Frances Jackson-Barry looks at some of the ways artists code interesting art, and how you can try out these techniques using Clojure and Quil.
