JUXT delivered an innovative new high-performance commodities trading application. In just a few months we went from an Excel-based prototype to a sophisticated browser-based MVP.

The application has pushed performance for data-intensive browser applications to the limit, with JUXT engineers bringing many technical innovations. Beyond MVP, JUXT engineers have become trusted members of the startup team.
