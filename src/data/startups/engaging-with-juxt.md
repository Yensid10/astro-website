When we engage with a project, we’ll complete a detailed discovery exercise to understand the domain and product vision. This allows us to validate the roadmap towards MVP, design an appropriate architecture, and select the right technologies.

Once discovery is complete, we’ll prepare the right team and get everything in place to start delivering from day one.
