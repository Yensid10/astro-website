We talk with stakeholders from across your organization and run deep-dive sessions to discuss the systems and features we'll build. We run face-to-face meetings and white-boarding sessions, we consume the documentation and design artefacts you have already, and we take copious notes. Discovery might happen over a half-day, or many days for larger projects.

Our goals during discovery are:

- to understand the context of the project in-depth
- to create a backlog of high-level product features

We split the backlog into phases, each lasting 6 to 12 weeks, and typically resource and price work phase-by-phase. Phasing helps us break down large projects into tractable pieces and allows our clients to take stock at regular intervals.

Once Discovery is complete, we create a Statement of Work covering the first phase of the project, which is a formal agreement outlining how many engineers we will devote to the project, how long for, the agreed rate(s), and the works we expect to complete.
