This is where we bring our skills and experience to bear, to build exceptional things, fast. During delivery weâ€™ll always:

- **Work iteratively**, delivering small changes incrementally and seeking regular feedback.
- **Communicate regularly and clearly**, so that progress on the project is well understood.
- **Be ready for change**, and react to it quickly.

Working iteratively means deploying features early and often, and seeking feedback to validate our path. With each iteration we will:

- Break down the next high-level features into detailed engineering tasks.
- Work with regular stand-up meetings that project stakeholders are welcome to join.
- Use demo sessions (Show & Tell) to explain recently delivered features and system components.
