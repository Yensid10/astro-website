JUXT is accelerating the adoption of Cloud Native technologies at a Tier 1 investment bank, including Kubernetes with Openshift and Amazon EKS, distributed data transformations with Apache Flink, and performant inter-system communication with gRPC.

These are made available as containerized "blueprints" which fully conform to company-wide best practices and are pre-configured for continuous integration and deployment.
