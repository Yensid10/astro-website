Over the past two years an engineering team from JUXT have been building a high-performance commodity trading application, with fast exchange feeds and instant sharing of internal data across teams.

The application is highly dynamic, pushing high volumes of data to clients with a degree of optimization and performance rarely seen in browser-based applications.

The system offers continuous sharing of data between active users, so the application is always live and synchronized.

Based on its success, JUXT have begun work on a project relating to Historical Forward Curves. This is a graphically-intensive application showing a wide range of forward curves for comparison.
