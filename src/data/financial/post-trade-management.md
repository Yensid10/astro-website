JUXT are building a post-trade capture and management platform for equity derivatives at a Tier 1 investment bank. Scalability and modularization is achieved with a container-based Microservices architecture, allowing effortless transition to cloud orchestration and deployment.

Our engineers are delivering an event-driven architecture, using Apache Kafka for log-based messaging between distributed systems.

This project has a strong test-driven design, ensuring consistency of behaviour with existing platforms.
