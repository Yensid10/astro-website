JUXTâ€™s software development experts were selected to complement the inhouse engineering team, to build the award-winning, publicly accessible Structured Notes platform for a major Tier 1 investment bank.

Entirely data-driven, the platform can rapidly onboard new Structured Products with zero code changes. The user-interface automatically adapts to the shape of the data required for each individual product.

The platform supports calendar deals, bespoke pricing, booking, and full post trade analysis, including for products booked outside of the platform. It provides comprehensive language localization, with an interface for conforming all fields and menu items to regional & desk-specific standards.

The platform has won industry awards for over 5 consecutive years, including 'Best Structured Product Technological Solution', and Bankers Investment Banking Award.
