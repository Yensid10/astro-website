JUXT have partnered with a Tier 1 investment bank to build an award-winning cross-asset strategic risk platform.

Over a multi-year period, the team have retired legacy risk platforms, decreased costs and increased the speed of delivery, giving the client an edge over the competition.

JUXT uses an agile, iterative and test-driven approach to maintain quality, reliability, adaptability, and continuous delivery.

The platform processes millions of risk calculations per day, combining raw risk data from the client’s inhouse quant libraries with market data to provide the latest risk data to traders, risk managers and regulators.
