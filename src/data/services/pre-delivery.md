Once weâ€™ve agreed a Statement of Work, we begin planning for delivery. We assign appropriate engineers, confirm and execute all onboarding steps (such as signing NDAs and creating relevant accounts), create shared channels of communication (we prefer Slack), organise a project kick-off meeting, and add other regular meetings (such as standups and demo sessions) to the diary.

We also establish a light-weight but effective governance structure that assures our projects without introducing unnecessary bureaucracy. This includes regular check-ins with JUXT senior management to discuss progress.

This Pre-Delivery work helps us ensure that everything is in place to make the best start.
