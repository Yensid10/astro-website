Many of our projects continue to evolve through repeated phases of delivery, but when live systems aren’t under active development we will often look to create a Support & Maintenance agreement.

Under a Support agreement we’ll provide expert help and guidance, as well as corrective and preventative maintenance to the system we’re supporting. We’ll apply essential security updates and fix bugs if found.

Stability and security are of the utmost importance, and any changes we make will typically be in service of these two goals.
